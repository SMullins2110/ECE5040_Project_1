# ECE5040_Project_1
Project 1's goal is to implement the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method using a specific grid convention:
The Electric Field (E_z) is located at the center of the Yee cell, while the Magnetic Field (H_y) is located at the cell edges.

The project1.py file includes a script that utilizes NumPy and matplotlib.pyplot to create different scenarios,
where the Courant factor S, the source line Ez[nx // 4] = pulse, dielectric material, and deviations in ∆x are modified to evaluate edge cases.
